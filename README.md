### http webserver template
Hello! This is a simple handler of webpages for your website. Am new to web development so it is the first project that I made yet.  

#### Features
- clean and understandable code
- seperates each webpage as file
---
#### How to use?
This is a template for your next website so you can modify it as you want. Here's how to get started:
- The `src/web/pages` contains scripts for webpages. An example is `home.js` located there. That file can be used for working with *headers*, *logics* etc.


- Also, `src/web/html` contains the style of your webpage. For instance, the `home.js` files reads contents of `home.html` and sends it as response.
